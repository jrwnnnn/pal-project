            <b style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Welcome on board our most important journey yet</b><br>
            <br>
            Flying is magic – one of humankind’s greatest achievements. It connects us with the rest of our world, brings loved ones closer together and opens our eyes to new experiences and cultures. It drives our economy, creates quality jobs and delivers aid when people need it most. But we recognise that flying comes at a cost to the environment and we need to take urgent action to tackle the impact it has on our planet. At Philippine Airlines, we’re on a journey to create a better, more sustainable future.<br>
            <br>
            It means working to minimise our impact on the planet and maximise our contribution to society. From creating a great place for people to work to reducing our emissions and waste and contributing to the communities we serve to build a thriving, resilient, responsible business. Our actions will help make a more connected world for everyone to live in and we're excited to bring together our people, our customers and our partners to deliver what we believe will be our greatest achievement.<br>
            <br>
            Welcome on board our most important journey yet.<br>

            Making Philippine Airlines a great place to work is a serious commitment we’re making to our people. We’re creating a workplace that’s diverse and inclusive, gives a sense of wellbeing and belonging and enables everyone to thrive.<br>

            <b>Planet</b>
            <br>
            We’re driving urgent action towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner. We know we have a long way to go, but we’re committed to reducing our emissions in the air and on the ground. Helping to reduce our impact on the environment, we advocate for respectful use of resources across our supply chain, eliminating single-use plastic and reducing food waste.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Responsible business</b>
            <br>
            We’re creating opportunities in the communities where we operate, whilst also using our unique skills to support those affected by crisis. Committed to maintaining the highest standard of corporate governance, we’re driving performance responsibly, and striving to make customer experiences more sustainable and inclusive.<br>
