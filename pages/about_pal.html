        <p class="heading">THE AIRLINE IN A NUTSHELL</p>
        <p class="article_body">
            Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the Philippines’ flag carrier and only full-service network airline, as well as the first commercial airline in Asia. PAL's fleet of Boeing, Airbus, and De Havilland aircraft operate scheduled nonstop flights out of hubs in Manila, Cebu, Clark, and Davao to 33 destinations in the Philippines and 40 destinations in Asia, North America, Australia, and the Middle East. Known for its hallmark heartwarming and gracious Filipino service, PAL also supports the global economy through air cargo and charter services, while serving the travel needs of overseas Filipinos as well as businesspeople, tourists and families from all over the world. <br>
            <br>
            <b>1940s</b><br>
            Commercial Aviation in its Infancy.<br>
            At the dawn of the aviation age, a pioneer spirit prevails even as people begin to experience the convenience of air travel. A fledgling airline starts its journey just as the war in the Pacific reaches the Philippines’ shores. Devastated by war but determined to serve its battered nation, Philippine Airlines presses its fleet into the war effort with the valiant support of its people. After the war, PAL takes up the mission of rebuilding the country through a growing network of air links across the islands and beyond to the wider world.<br>
            <br>
            <b>1950s</b><br>
            Spanning two thirds of the World. <br>
            The world is recovering from war and Philippine trade is growing - PAL’s network expands from Manila to as far east as London and as far west as San Francisco. This progress is interrupted when, less than halfway through the decade, the government instructs the airline to suspend most international flights. As the 1960s approach, PAL renews its long-haul ambitions and looks forward to jet-powered aircraft.<br>
            <br>
            <b>1960s</b><br>
            PAL Enters the Jet - Age  <br>
            The flag carrier enters the age of jet-powered aircraft and re-establishes its mission to relink the Philippines to the world. Passengers beginto sample the comforts of shorter travel times on Douglas DC-8s for international flights and BAC One Elevens on domestic flights.  <br><br>
            <img src="https://www.philippineairlines.com/-/media/files/historyandmilestonespalsstory/1960s/images-for-web-1960s-intro.jpg?h=314&w=454" style="width: 100%;"><br>
            <br>
            <b>1970s</b><br>
            Changing with the Times. <br>
            The airline introduces more routes into its network, making Manila a true crossroads of Asia and a gateway between the East and West. A 1974 merger makes PAL the sole flag carrier of the Philippines. PAL acquires its first widebody aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, in a quest to compete more effectively on the highly contested trans-Pacific route. <br>
            <br>
            <b>1980s</b><br>
            Joining the “Big” League <br>
            PAL elevates the passenger experience with the introduction of the Boeing 747 for transpacific and European services, along with the twinjet Airbus A300 for regional services.  The carrier continues to modernize its domestic fleet with Fokker 50s, Shorts SD 360s and the best-selling Boeing 737. <br>
            <br>
            <b>1990s</b><br>
            The Quest to Become Asia’s Best <br>
            PAL returns to private hands after Dr. Lucio C. Tan acquires a majority stake in the airline. In its push to modernize, PAL orders a wave of modern aircraft including Boeing’s longer-range B747-400 and a family of Airbus A330s, A340s and A320s.  <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>2000s</b><br>
            With You All The Way <br>
            Emerging from a challenging decade, PAL recommits to its network-building mission. The flag carrier restores more routes, rebuilds its secondary hub in Cebu, reintroduces turboprop services through its affiliate PAL Express, and accepts its first long-haul twinjet, theBoeing 777-300ER. <br>

            <br>
            <b>2010s</b><br>
            Soaring to Greater Heights <br>
            PAL continues to enhance offerings with new nonstop flights to the east coast of North America using new Trans-Polar routings, the comeback of Middle East services, and the entry of more advanced De Havilland Dash 8-400s for inter-island flights and the Airbus A350-900s and Airbus A321neos for premium quality service on international routes. <br>
            <br>
            <b>2010s</b><br>
            Flying into the Future <br>
            PAL is moving forward after emerging from a destructive global pandemic. Asia’s first airline continues to innovate and enhance its products as part of a strategy of digital transformation and progressive network expansion – while serving the travel needs of Filipinos as well as businesspeople, tourists and families from all over the world. <br>
