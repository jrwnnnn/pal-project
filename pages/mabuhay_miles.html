        <p class="article_body">
            Mabuhay Miles is the frequent flyer program offered by Philippine Airlines (PAL). It rewards passengers for flying with PAL and its partner airlines, allowing them to accumulate points redeemable for various travel benefits.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Earning Miles:</b>
            <br>
            • Flights with PAL or partner airlines: The core way to earn miles is by flying with Philippine Airlines or any of their partner airlines. The number of miles earned typically depends on the distance flown, fare class, and booking category.<br>
            • Partner program participation:  Mabuhay Miles has partnered with various credit cards, hotels, and other service providers. By using their services or making purchases with their products, you can also earn miles to add to your account.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Redeeming Miles:</b>
            The accumulated miles can be redeemed for several travel-related benefits:<br>
            • Free flights: This is likely the most sought-after reward. You can redeem your miles for free flights on Philippine Airlines or partner airlines, depending on their availability and your desired destination.<br>
            • Seat upgrades:  Looking for more comfort on your flight? You can use your miles to upgrade your seat to a higher class, such as business or premium economy, subject to seat availability.<br>
            • Excess baggage allowance:  Traveling with extra luggage? Mabuhay Miles allows you to redeem miles for additional baggage allowance, so you won't have to worry about paying excess baggage fees.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tier System:</b>
            <br>
            Mabuhay Miles has a tiered membership system. The more miles you earn, the higher your tier level. As you progress through the tiers, you unlock additional benefits and privileges, such as priority boarding, lounge access, and bonus miles on flights.
